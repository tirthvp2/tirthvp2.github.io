        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I‚Äôm a Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience specializing in machine data analytics, advanced visualization, and process optimization. I‚Äôm adept at delivering client-centric solutions by leveraging Python scripting, SQL query optimization, and Tableau dashboard development. I‚Äôve demonstrated success in boosting process efficiency by 30%, engineering innovative analytical tools, and generating actionable, data-driven insights. I‚Äôm skilled in identifying operational enhancements and collaborating with stakeholders to maximize engagement and boost project adoption by 20%. I‚Äôm eager to secure a data science position to refine industrial performance and pioneer cutting-edge analytical methodologies.</p>
        <h2>A Lot About Me</h2>
        <h3>My Journey as a Data-Driven Innovator and Curious Explorer</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôm Tirth Patel, a passionate Data Analyst based in Chicago, Illinois, with a deep-rooted love for science, technology, and exploration. My academic journey began at the College of DuPage, where I earned an Associate of Science in Physics and Mathematics with a 3.89 GPA, securing First Prize in the AMATYC Student Mathematics League in Fall 2018. I continued my education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Mathematics (GPA: 3.7/4.0) in 2021. During my time there, I was honored to be on the Dean‚Äôs Top 20% List from Spring 2020 to Fall 2021, diving into challenging coursework like quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and linear algebra that fueled my analytical mindset.</p>
        <p>Since November 2022, I‚Äôve been working as a Data Analyst at Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Illinois, where I‚Äôve honed my skills in machine data analytics, predictive modeling, and data visualization. Using Python, SQL, and Tableau, I‚Äôve optimized big data workflows by 30%, deployed over five live dashboards for real-time insights, and developed a Scikit-Learn clustering algorithm that boosted emission forecasting accuracy by 25%. Before that, I served as a Research Assistant at UIUC, where I innovated surface-cleaning methods for 2D materials like graphene, designed experimental tools with Fusion 360, and worked on nanoscale research using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. I also spent time as a Peer Tutor at the College of DuPage, mentoring over 10 new tutors and managing a student database for 200+ learners, which taught me the value of collaboration and leadership.</p>
        <p>My project portfolio reflects my passion for innovation and problem-solving. At the International High Tech Championship in 2023, I engineered a neural network with PyTorch, DALL¬∑E 2, and Imagen, achieving a 25% efficiency gain on platforms like Google Colab. My Noise Profiles Near Wind Turbines project in Spring 2020 involved designing a PCB with Arduino sensors to analyze environmental data, while other projects‚Äîlike a deterministic transfer station for 2D materials and an Android trivia app, ‚ÄúBattle of Wits‚Äù‚Äîshowcase my ability to blend software, hardware, and scientific research. My technical skills include Python, SQL, C++, Java, R, and tools like Tableau, MATLAB, and AutoCAD, backed by certifications in Tableau Desktop Specialist, Python for Data Science, and SQL for Data Analysis.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I‚Äôm a curious and creative individual with diverse interests that keep me engaged and inspired. I love the mental challenge of chess and solving Rubik‚Äôs Cubes, often spending hours perfecting my strategies. Playing snooker with friends brings out my competitive yet social side, while reading books‚Äîespecially on science, technology, and new ideas‚Äîsatisfies my thirst for knowledge. I find freedom and adventure in riding my motorcycle, feeling the wind as I explore new routes. My fascination with the cosmos, nurtured through the Astronomy Club at the College of DuPage, continues with my telescope, Peggy, which I use to gaze at the stars and ponder the universe‚Äôs mysteries.</p>
        <p>Creativity is a big part of my life, as seen in my Netflix-themed portfolio website, where I designed playful sunglasses avatars in a sleek dark layout. In my free time, I enjoy replicating digital art, experimenting with designs to express my artistic side. I‚Äôm also passionate about travel and cultural exploration‚ÄîI dream of traveling the world, immersing myself in diverse traditions and cuisines before I grow older. When I unwind with media, I‚Äôm drawn to thought-provoking series like HBO‚Äôs *Chernobyl* and *Breaking Bad*, captivated by their intricate storytelling. On a more hands-on note, I‚Äôve poured my problem-solving skills into restoring a 2003 Honda Accord, a project that blends my mechanical interests with my love for tackling challenges.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to make an impact through data science. Whether I‚Äôm optimizing a big data pipeline, designing an experimental tool, or exploring a new hobby, I strive to learn, innovate, and connect with the world around me. My journey is one of continuous growth, and I‚Äôm excited to see where my skills and passions take me next.</p>
